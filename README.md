This project was built as part of the [React Redux](https://learn.tylermcginnis.com/courses/) course curriculum created by [@tylermcginnis](https://twitter.com/tylermcginnis). It was built with React, Redux, React Router and Immutable.js.

All data is persisted in the Firebase real-time database. The authentication is also implemented with Firebase + Facebook OAuth engine.

The Duckr app is a Twitter-like app that allows you to post your Ducks (not Tweets, ok? lol). You will be able to see all Ducks in your feed, as well as access others users' feed. You may also comment in existent Ducks and interact with the others users.

Access the live version [here](https://duckr.firebaseapp.com).
